325::a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out of kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill conceived action pieces
326::the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written in the thrall of a vicious hangover

437::city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving it 's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing

444::a picture that extols the virtues of comradeship and community in a spunky , spirited fashion

447::the cast comes through even when the movie does n't
448::it 's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit and miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes
449::a story , an old and scary one , about the monsters we make , and the vengeance they take
450::there is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye
451::we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they 'll wind up together , and michele 's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest
452::thoroughly awful
453::that rare movie that works on any number of levels as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults

463::an extraordinary swedish film about the soul adventure of marriage the kind of intimate and character driven film that bille august does best
464::coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock
465::aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music
466::needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey
467::the film is darkly atmospheric , with herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath hearst 's forced avuncular chortles
468::the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus
469::the story ultimately takes hold and grips hard
470::not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you 'll have a good time with this one too

478::enough similarities to gymkata and howie long 's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long suffering eyeballs
479::this cinema verite speculation on the assassination of john f kennedy may have been inspired by blair witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative
480::t here 's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , anne rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built in silliness of the whole affair defeats them

484::the holes in this film remain agape holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot
485::directors harry gantz and joe gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter , but the couples exposing themselves are n't all that interesting

788::e t works because its flabbergasting principals , 14 year old robert macnaughton , 6 year old drew barrymore and 10 year old henry thomas , convince us of the existence of the wise , wizened visitor from a faraway planet
789::if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you 're in for a painful ride
790::an intriguing cinematic omnibus and round robin that occasionally is more interesting in concept than in execution
791::has a lot of the virtues of eastwood at his best
792::an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish out of water story
793::denis' bare bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product
794::like leon , it 's frustrating and still oddly likable
795::a miraculous movie , i'm going home is so slight , yet overflows with wisdom and emotion
796::about one in three gags in white 's intermittently wise script hits its mark the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen exploitation playbook
797::u nrelentingly stupid
798::while the transgressive trappings \( especially the frank sex scenes \) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues 's beast within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative
799::to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape is overkill to the highest degree
800::yet another weepy southern bore athon
801::a very funny look at how another culture handles the process of courting and marriage
802::manages to be wholesome and subversive at the same time
803::the material and the production itself are little more than routine
804::another example of how sandler is losing his touch
805::the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments
806::whether you like rap music or loathe it , you ca n't deny either the tragic loss of two young men in the prime of their talent or the power of this movie
807::works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making
808::there is a subversive element to this disney cartoon , providing unexpected fizzability
809::essentially fatal attraction remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along
810::intimate and panoramic
811::as janice , eileen walsh , an engaging , wide eyed actress whose teeth are a little too big for her mouth , infuses the movie with much of its slender , glinting charm
812::yes they can swim , the title is merely anne sophie birot 's off handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through
813::several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in unfaithful why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me
814::the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters
815::too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining
816::sweet and memorable film
817::the dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so
818::julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan
819::the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter
820::a lot more dimensional and complex than its sunny disposition would lead you to believe
821::they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who have n't read the book
822::the emperor 's club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality
823::like other great documentaries this goes after one truth \( the ford administration 's complicity in tearing 'orphans' from their mothers \) and stumbles upon others even more compelling
824::if the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic heaven will quite likely be more like hell
825::too sappy for its own good
826::this is n't a friday worth waiting for
827::leigh 's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of margaret thatcher 's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other
828::while the new film is much more eye catching than its blood drenched stephen norrington directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s goyer is much sillier
829::none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any 'comedy' to ever spill from a projector 's lens
830::not at all clear what it 's trying to say and even if it were i doubt it would be all that interesting
831::both a beautifully made nature film and a tribute to a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes
832::consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
833::the corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption
834::for all its failed connections , divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way
835::the santa clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be
836::a satisfying niblet
837::the story is familiar from its many predecessors like them , it eventually culminates in the not exactly stunning insight that crime does n't pay
838::not even the hanson brothers can save it
839::this remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise al pacino loathing robin williams
840::tackling a low budget movie in which inexperienced children play the two main characters might not be the best way to cut your teeth in the film industry
841::as a director , paxton is surprisingly brilliant , deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head trip
842::the pleasures that it does afford may be enough to keep many moviegoers occupied amidst some of the more serious minded concerns of other year end movies
843::hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in burdette 's dialogue
844::an action thriller of the finest kind , evoking memories of day of the jackal , the french connection , and heat
845::even though the film does n't manage to hit all of its marks , it 's still entertaining to watch the target practice
846::the four feathers has rewards , from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes
847::once again , director chris columbus takes a hat in hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours
848::cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate vincent 's days
849::an empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance
850::love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly was n't feeling any of it
851::the leaping story line , shaped by director peter kosminsky into sharp slivers and cutting impressions , shows all the signs of rich detail condensed into a few evocative images and striking character traits
852::does n't add up to much
853::fans of plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers
854::once ice t sticks his mug in the window of the couple 's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window
855::cedar takes a very open minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing
856::the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr desplechin is content to state it
857::unfortunately , it appears that jackie chan 's us influence is starting to show in his hong kong films
858::it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept
859::adaptation 's success in engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay is extraordinary
860::a thriller without a lot of thrills
861::a respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain trek films cross over to a more mainstream audience
862::at best , cletis tout might inspire a trip to the video store in search of a better movie experience
863::at its best festival in cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in cannes
864::with rabbit proof fence , noyce has tailored an epic tale into a lean , economical movie
865::more busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining
866::allen shows he can outgag any of those young whippersnappers making moving pictures today
867::this is the first film i 've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved
868::i liked this film a lot
869::jaw droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter 's glory days on three 's company
870::moore 's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that 's still very much playing itself out
871::like dickens with his passages , mcgrath crafts quite moving scenes throughout his resolutely dramatic variation on the novel
872::is n't quite the equal of woo 's best earlier work , but it 's easily his finest american film comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his hong kong films
873::often hilarious , well shot and , importantly , entertaining , hell house is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed
874::the result is mesmerizing filled with menace and squalor
875::has its moments and almost as many subplots
876::takes one character we do n't like and another we do n't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and is n't very funny
877::it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time
878::on its own , it 's not very interesting as a remake , it 's a pale imitation
879::it 's as if solondz had two ideas for two movies , could n't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped em together here
880::has a shambling charm a cheerfully inconsequential diversion
881::john carlen 's script is full of unhappy , two dimensional characters who are anything but compelling
882::this rather unfocused , all over the map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens or if it were subtler or if it had a sense of humor
883::the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep i like frank the pug , though
884::not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time
885::the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie
886::offers that rare combination of entertainment and education
887::the merchant ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it 's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage
888::gay or straight , kissing jessica stein is one of the greatest date movies in years
889::for its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded
890::borstal boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy
891::what frei gives us is a man who uses the damage of war far more often than the warfare itself to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows
892::it uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color
893::leaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time
894::could have been crisper and punchier , but it 's likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies
895::in addition to scoring high for originality of plot putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way lilo stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded
896::it represents better than average movie making that does n't demand a dumb , distracted audience
897::a must see for all sides of the political spectrum
898::maelstrom is a deliberately unsteady mixture of stylistic elements
899::a genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way to consider what we value in our daily lives
900::the film is a verbal duel between two gifted performers
901::romanek 's themes are every bit as distinctive as his visuals beyond the cleverness , the weirdness and the pristine camerawork , one hour photo is a sobering meditation on why we take pictures
902::sure , it 's contrived and predictable , but its performances are so well tuned that the film comes off winningly , even though it 's never as solid as you want it to be
903::kung pow is oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that

908::smith 's point is simple and obvious people 's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces but his subjects are charmers
909::the stripped down dramatic constructs , austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics , obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt
910::it 's not without its pleasures , but i 'll stick with the tune
911::a seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer director kurt wimmer at the screenplay level
912::the film is surprisingly well directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well at least until the problematic third act
913::overly long and worshipful bio doc
914::to build a feel good fantasy around a vain dictator madman is off putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved
915::the script by vincent r nebrida tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot
916::crush is so warm and fuzzy you might be able to forgive its mean spirited second half
917::as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction
918::devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly rendered cgi effects
919::a gorgeously strange movie , heaven is deeply concerned with morality , but it refuses to spell things out for viewers
920::in both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you you end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that
921::like a fish that 's lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places
922::in the second half of the film , frei 's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self analysis
923::w hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall 's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands
924::this is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but it 's pleasant enough and oozing with attractive men
925::adam sandler 's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice over hero in columbia pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie
926::this low rent and even lower wit rip off of the farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy and in a relatively short amount of time
927::the vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together
928::this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad 's wallet
929::bears is bad not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it 's now coming true' bad
930::the film has a kind of hard , cold effect
931::i do n't think i 've been as entranced and appalled by an asian film since shinya tsukamoto 's iron man
932::with a spy kids sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a snl has been acting like an 8 year old channeling roberto benigni \?
933::sayles is making a statement about the inability of dreams and aspirations to carry forward into the next generation
934::a wild ride with eight boarders from venice beach that was a deserved co winner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival
935::staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce
936::as gory as the scenes of torture and self mutilation may be , they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting
937::a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet
938::its rawness and vitality give it considerable punch
939::under 15 \? a giggle a minute over age 15 \? big fat waste of time
940::boring and meandering
941::weighty and ponderous but every bit as filling as the treat of the title
942::filled with alexandre desplat 's haunting and sublime music , the movie completely transfixes the audience
943::martin scorsese cria um espet culo visual que n o possui alma um filme esteticamente belo , mas emocionalmente frio
944::hugely accomplished slice of hitchcockian suspense
945::a hypnotic cyber hymn and a cruel story of youth culture
946::an uncomfortable movie , suffocating and sometimes almost senseless , the grey zone does have a center , though a morbid one
947::the trick when watching godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them
948::there has been much puzzlement among critics about what the election symbolizes i believe the message is in the messenger the agent is a woman
949::safe conduct , however ambitious and well intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull 's eye
950::a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls
951::energetic and boldly provocative
952::a big budget all star movie as unblinkingly pure as the hours is a distinct rarity , and an event
953::one of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning
954::lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose
955::nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams
956::cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience
957::kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party
958::nothing more or less than an outright bodice ripper it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows
959::maryam is more timely now than ever
960::while obviously aimed at kids , the country bears should keep parents amused with its low groan to guffaw ratio
961::always destined to be measured against anthony asquith 's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation
962::this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well made b movie is long gone
963::scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf
964::an excellent romp that boasts both a heart and a mind
965::passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless
966::peter jackson has done the nearly impossible he has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper what jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery
967::it 's an often cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing
968::if s m seems like a strange route to true love , maybe it is , but it 's to this film 's \( and its makers' \) credit that we believe that that 's exactly what these two people need to find each other and themselves
969::a well acted and well intentioned snoozer
970::further proof that the epicenter of cool , beautiful , thought provoking foreign cinema is smack dab in the middle of dubya 's axis of evil
971::hashiguchi uses the situation to evoke a japan bustling atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation
972::this chicago has hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit , as well as one terrific score and attitude to spare
973::this masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short
974::supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy alas , getting there is not even half the interest
975::like mike does n't win any points for originality it does succeed by following a feel good formula with a winning style , and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism
976::a lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low wattage endeavor
977::the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave immediately

981::it 's a 100 year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by elizabeth hurley in a bathing suit
982::ken russell would love this in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double barreled rip off of quentin tarantino 's climactic shootout and meat loaf explodes
983::stealing harvard does n't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor
984::not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense
985::the director , mark pellington , does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister , menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head
986::the result is something quite fresh and delightful
987::sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past a lesson this film teaches all too well
988::it 's a hoot watching the rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire !
989::starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill
990::so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter 's the thing and loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat
991::sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the wwii era mississippi delta undermine this adaptation
992::a well rounded tribute to a man whose achievements and complexities reached far beyond the end zone
993::too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient
994::captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics
995::too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style
996::visually exciting sci fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay
997::spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
998::its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it 's too slowly paced to be a thriller but it 's worth recommending because of two marvelous performances by michael caine and brendan fraser
999::schaeffer is n't in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does
1000::the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it 's far too sentimental
